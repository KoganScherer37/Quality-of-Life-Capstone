# Quality-of-Life-Capstone
During this project, I intend to look into three major cities in the Southern United States including Nashville, TN, Atlanta, GA and Austin, TX and determine which of these cities has the best chance of having a high quality of life. The parameters I will be looking into are the real estate market, cost of living, average salary, unemployment rates and crime rates.

#Motivation
One major motivating for me wanting to work on such a project is that My wife and I bought our first house a few years ago. In that process we felt that there were a few things we should have done a little more research on prior to making that investment. Therefore, my main goal is to create a good starting point for key contributors when one is purchasing their first or just their next home.
