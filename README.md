# Quality-of-Life-Capstone

During this project, I intend to look into three major cities in the Southern United States including Nashville, TN, Atlanta, GA and Austin, TX and determine which of these cities has the best chance of having a high quality of life. The parameters I will be looking into are the real estate markets, cost of living, average salary, unemployment rates and crime rates from 2018 to present.


### Motivation

One major motivating for me wanting to work on such a project is that My wife and I bought our first house a few years ago. In that process we felt that there were a few things we should have done a little more research on prior to making that investment. Therefore, my main goal is to create a good starting point for key contributors when one is purchasing their first or just their next home.


### Data Questions

1. Overall comparison between real estate markets in each city. For this question, I will be examining inventory counts in comparison with sales counts. I will also be presenting data for average home values for 1 to 5 bedroom properties. Finally, I will be touching on forecasting for this coming year.

2. In this question, I will be diving into comparisons between average monthly mortgage payments 1 to 5 bedroom properties and monthly average salaries for each city.

3. At this point, I will be presenting some economic statistics including gross domestic product and price parities for basic necessities such as housing, utilities and goods which include food, clothing, medical expenses, et cetera between cities.

4. Now, I will now be analyzing unemployment rates for each city.

5. Finally, I will be examining crime rates in order to determine which of these cities is theoretically the safest.
